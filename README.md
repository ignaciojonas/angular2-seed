# Angular 2 Seed Project
This project is based on the [Angular2-GettingStarted](https://github.com/DeborahK/Angular2-GettingStarted) of Debora Kurata.
I removed some files and updated the dependencies to the latest Angular 2 beta release.

In order to have this seed project working in your computer:
* Open a command prompt in the project's root directory

* Type `npm install`

This installs the dependencies as defined in the package.json file.

* Type `npm start`

This launches the TypeScript compiler (tsc) to compile the application and wait for changes.
It also starts the lite-server and launches the browser to run the application.
